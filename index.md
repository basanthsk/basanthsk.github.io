### Understanding The Disconnect between Skills and Jobs in Ghana usning NLP

Using web scrapping techniques, collected job description and candidate resume data from relevant websites. Fine-tuned DistilBERT, an NLP model, using the job description data to classify candidate resumes into different job categories based on their text. This project enabled fast and accurate analysis of large text data sets to extract insights from job description and candidate resume data. It also showcased my technical skills in NLP and my ability to use advanced tools and methods to solve complex data science challenges.

### End-to-End AI/ML project for detection of chicken diseases using images of poultry fecal as the basis for its detection

In order to diagnose poultry diseases for small- to medium-scale poultry farmers, images of poultry fecal are used. The images are classified as "Coccidiosis", "Healthy", "New Castle Disease", and "Salmonella".

The Python code is developed in a modular design based on the OOPS principle, and DVC is used for model and data monitoring, as well as versioning. The project has been containerized and deployed to AWS.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommender System 

In this project, we aim to implement a deep reinforcement learning based recommender system, inspired by the paper Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation with Explicit User-Item Interactions Modeling by Liu et al. We use the DDPG algorithm, which combines actor-critic and deterministic policy gradient methods, to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward for recommending items to users. To handle the high-dimensional and sparse user-item interaction data, we add a state representation module that transforms the data into a trainable state vector for the RL algorithm. This is not the official implementation of the paper, but our own attempt to reproduce and extend their work.
