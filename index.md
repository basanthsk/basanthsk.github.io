### Understanding The Disconnect between Skills and Jobs in Ghana usning NLP

Gathered relevant job description and candidate resume data from appropriate websites using web scrapping techniques, built an NLP model to by finetuning DistilBERT using job description data. The build model is used to find the category of  candidate resume based on the text into relevant job categories
The model enabled efficient processing of large amounts of text data to quickly analyze and extract insights from job description and candidate resume data. This project demonstrated technical expertise in NLP and ability to leverage cutting-edge tools and techniques to solve complex data science problems

### End-to-End AI/ML project for detection of chicken diseases using images of poultry fecal as the basis for its detection

In order to diagnose poultry diseases for small- to medium-scale poultry farmers, images of poultry fecal are used. The images are classified as "Coccidiosis", "Healthy", "New Castle Disease", and "Salmonella".

The Python code is developed in a modular design based on the OOPS principle, and DVC is used for model and data monitoring, as well as versioning. The project has been containerized and deployed to AWS.
